    // Running this code results in a stack overflow, hence I believe that this shows Java does not support tail recursion optimisation.
    // As an example of the stack, take i to be 1 initially, would look like:
    // recursion(1)
    // recursion(2)
    // recursion(3) ... and so on.
    // There is no extra data alongside each call to the function, therefore a tail recursion optimisation would
    // remove the earlier calls to the function, as it would know they are not needed again.
